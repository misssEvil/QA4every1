Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.
The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.
It should look like this:

Sam Harris => S.H

All of the animals are having a feast! Each animal is bringing one dish. There is just one rule: the dish must start and end with the same letters as the animal's name. 
For example, the great blue heron is bringing garlic naan and the chickadee is bringing chocolate cake.
Write a function feast that takes the animal's name and dish as arguments and returns true or false to indicate whether the beast is allowed to bring the dish to the feast.
Assume that beast and dish are always lowercase strings, and that each has at least two letters. beast and dish may contain hyphens and spaces, but these will not appear at the beginning or end of the string. They will not contain numerals.

Triple Trouble
Create a function that will return a string that combines all of the letters of the three inputed strings in groups. Taking the first letter of all of the inputs and grouping them next to each other. Do this for every letter, see example below!
E.g. Input: "aa", "bb" , "cc" => Output: "abcabc" 
Note: You can expect all of the inputs to be the same length.

I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.
P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations.
The function should take three arguments - operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).
The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation.

Examples(Operator, value1, value2) --> output
('+', 4, 7) --> 11
('-', 15, 18) --> -3
('*', 5, 5) --> 25
('/', 49, 7) --> 7
